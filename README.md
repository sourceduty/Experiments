Enclosing a Wi-Fi router in different materials can significantly impact the strength and quality of the Wi-Fi signal due to the materials' ability to absorb or reflect radio waves. Here's a simplified simulation of how various common materials might affect Wi-Fi signal strength:

**Plastic:**
 Generally, thin plastic may have a minimal impact on Wi-Fi signals. It's often used in the construction of the router itself. However, thicker plastics or those with high-density compositions might start to slightly reduce signal strength.

**Wood:** Wood can weaken Wi-Fi signals, especially if it's thick or if the signal has to pass through multiple layers (like floors or heavy furniture). The denser the wood, the more it can degrade the signal.

**Glass:** Standard glass doesn't significantly obstruct Wi-Fi signals, but the impact can vary. For example, thick, leaded, or frosted glass can be more obstructive. Energy-efficient thermal glass, often used in modern construction, can also severely weaken Wi-Fi signals because it contains metal oxide coatings.

**Brick and Concrete:** These materials are quite dense and can significantly reduce Wi-Fi signal strength. The signal might pass through thin walls with some strength reduction, but thicker walls can block the signal more substantially.

**Metal:** Metal is highly reflective to radio waves and can almost completely block Wi-Fi signals. Encasing a router in a metal box would likely result in a severe reduction or total blockage of the signal. This is due to the Faraday cage effect, where a conductive enclosure blocks electromagnetic fields.

**Water:** Large bodies of water, including aquariums, can absorb Wi-Fi signals, as water has a dampening effect on radio wave propagation. Even high humidity levels can slightly impact signal strength over large distances.

When a Wi-Fi signal encounters these materials, several things can happen: absorption (where the material takes in the signal energy), reflection (where the signal bounces off the surface), and refraction (where the signal changes direction as it passes through the material). The specific impact depends on the material's thickness, density, and composition, as well as the frequency of the Wi-Fi signal (with 2.4 GHz signals generally penetrating obstacles better than 5 GHz signals).

Remember, this is a simplified overview. Actual results can vary based on the specific characteristics of the materials, the environment, and the router's technology. For optimal Wi-Fi performance, it's best to place routers in open spaces and away from materials that can significantly degrade signal strength.

### Experiment Simulation

Simulating the estimated signal loss when a Wi-Fi router is enclosed in different materials involves understanding how different materials attenuate (weaken) radio frequency (RF) signals. This attenuation is typically measured in decibels (dB). A higher dB value indicates more significant signal loss.

It's important to note that these values are approximate and can vary based on factors such as frequency, material thickness, and environmental conditions. Wi-Fi signals commonly operate at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies, with 5 GHz signals generally experiencing more attenuation through materials than 2.4 GHz signals.

Here's a simplified simulation of estimated signal loss for common materials:

**Plastic:** 0-3 dB. Thin plastic has minimal effect on Wi-Fi signals, but thicker or denser plastic types might cause slight attenuation.

**Wood:** 2-5 dB. Wood can vary widely in its impact on signal strength, depending on its type and thickness. Softwoods like pine will generally cause less attenuation than denser hardwoods.

**Glass:** 2-7 dB. Standard window glass might only slightly attenuate Wi-Fi signals, but specialized types like bulletproof or thermal insulating glass can have a much more significant effect.

**Brick:** 4-12 dB. The denser the brick, the more signal loss you can expect. A single brick wall might cause moderate attenuation, but multiple walls can severely degrade the signal.

**Concrete:** 10-20 dB. Concrete, especially reinforced concrete, can significantly block Wi-Fi signals. The exact loss depends on the thickness and density of the concrete.

**Metal:** 30-100+ dB. Metal can almost completely reflect Wi-Fi signals, causing severe attenuation. Enclosing a router in a metal box could lead to a total loss of signal.

**Water:** 15-20 dB per meter. Water absorbs RF energy, so passing a Wi-Fi signal through a large aquarium or a similar body of water can significantly weaken it.

Keep in mind that these are estimated values for signal loss and actual results can vary. Signal attenuation also depends on the cumulative effect of all materials and objects in the signal's path, as well as the router's specific characteristics and the environmental context. For practical Wi-Fi deployment, it's important to minimize obstructions and materials in the signal path that can significantly degrade signal quality.

<details><summary>Center of mass (COM) of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4</summary>
<br>

![Center of Mass](https://github.com/sourceduty/Experiments/assets/123030236/90651028-e471-4c70-b693-268de500a13d)

The center of mass (COM) of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4, assuming uniform density for simplicity, lies at the geometric center in both its folded and unfolded states. In its folded state, with dimensions 84.9 x 71.9 x 16.5 mm (averaging the thickness), the COM is approximately 42.45 mm from the bottom edge, 35.95 mm from the side, and 8.25 mm deep. Unfolded, at 165.2 x 71.9 x 6.9 mm, the COM shifts to 82.6 mm from the bottom, remains 35.95 mm from the side, and is 3.45 mm deep. This simplistic model doesn't account for the non-uniform distribution of internal components or the intricate hinge mechanism in the folded state, which could notably alter the actual COM.

### Folded State

- Dimensions: 84.9 mm (height) x 71.9 mm (width) x 16.5 mm (average thickness)
- COM Position (from the bottom edge, assuming the phone stands on one of the 71.9 mm sides):
  - COM height = 84.9 mm / 2 = 42.45 mm
  - COM width = 71.9 mm / 2 = 35.95 mm
  - COM depth = 16.5 mm / 2 = 8.25 mm

### Unfolded State

- Dimensions: 165.2 mm (height) x 71.9 mm (width) x 6.9 mm (thickness)
- COM Position (from the bottom edge, with the phone standing on one of the 71.9 mm sides):
  - COM height = 165.2 mm / 2 = 82.6 mm
  - COM width = 71.9 mm / 2 = 35.95 mm
  - COM depth = 6.9 mm / 2 = 3.45 mm

### Considerations

- The actual mass distribution in a smartphone is not uniform due to internal components, causing deviations from these calculated COM positions.
- In the folded state, the hinge and differential mass distribution between halves complicate COM calculation.
- For precise COM determination, especially folded, a complex model accounting for internal mass distribution or experimental methods might be needed.

### Stability

The stability of an object like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4, influenced by its center of mass (COM), can vary significantly across different scenarios.

1. Resting on a Surface:

   - Folded: Lower COM makes it more stable against tipping. Smaller base area may reduce stability against sliding.
   - Unfolded: Higher COM makes it less stable against tipping but larger base area improves stability against sliding.

2. Spinning:

   - Folded: Lower COM enhances spinning stability, reducing wobble. Smaller moment of inertia may affect spin smoothness and duration.
   - Unfolded: Higher COM could increase wobble, but larger moment of inertia allows for smoother, longer spins.

3. Being Held or Manipulated:

   - The COM affects handling comfort and security. Folded state may feel more balanced, while unfolded might feel top-heavy, especially with one-hand use.

4. Mounted or Docked:

   - Folded: Lower COM offers stability in mounts, reducing tipping likelihood.
   - Unfolded: Higher COM requires mount designs to counteract potential instability by supporting the device lower or increasing the mount's base area.

5. In Motion (e.g., in a moving vehicle):

   - A lower COM (folded) means less likelihood of tipping over with sudden movements. The unfolded state, with its higher COM, might be more prone to tipping with sharp turns or sudden stops.

6. Vibration Resistance:

   - Folded: Lower COM makes the device more resistant to being moved or tipped over by external vibrations.
   - Unfolded: Higher COM makes it more susceptible to vibrations, potentially causing it to move more easily.
     
In each scenario, the stability conferred by the COM interacts with other factors, like the base area, friction with the surface, external forces, and the moment of inertia. These examples highlight how the state of the device (folded vs. unfolded) can lead to different stability outcomes depending on the specific situation and environmental conditions.
